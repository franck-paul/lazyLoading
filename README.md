Lazy Loading plugin for Dotclear 2
==================================

This plugin adds loading="lazy" attribute for img and iframe html element in contents of entries and comments.
Inspired by the [WP Lazy Loading plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/wp-lazy-loading)

Must be activated for the blog (see blog parameters)

Note that this attribute [may not be supported by every browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=loading-lazy-attr) yet.
